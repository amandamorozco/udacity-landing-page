          <p>
            You’re tired of the same old mealtime routine--go to the fridge,
            rummage around between items of questionable freshness, too many
            leftover containers… well, you get the idea. You’re overwhelmed and
            hungry--and so is everyone else in your house. So you go for what’s
            easy and quick. <br />
            <br />
            Or, you want to do what you can to care for the planet, but are
            overwhelmed by the amount of products out there to “help you” (and
            are pretty sure most of those items are just creating more clutter
            and adding to the problem) and by “solutions” that require way too
            much thinking and planning that just don’t fit into your busy
            lifestyle. <br />
            <br />
            Not sure where to begin, or even if it’s worth the effort? <br />
            <br />
            Small Steps, Big Change is all about how to eat (and live)
            healthier, all while caring for the planet (and your wallet).
            Healthy change doesn’t have to be difficult, or expensive. It also
            doesn’t have to be complicated. But if you can take one small step
            today, and then tomorrow, and it becomes a part of your routine…
            well, the benefits can be exponential. So let’s get started--one
            small, simple step at a time. Each of the steps we’ll discuss here
            are designed to be simple and stand alone--no need for a complete
            overhaul of your home or routine. So you can adopt the ones that
            make sense for you, and get started. The key is to take those small
            steps so you can get headed towards big change.

                  “A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.” We can
                  all probably think of at least one way in which we should be
                  living or eating healthier, but it can seem overwhelming to
                  make big changes to our diet or lives. What if instead we
                  chose each day to take just one small step?
